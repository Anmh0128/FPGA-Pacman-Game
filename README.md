# FPGA-Based Multi-Board Pacman Game with Integrated AI 
## üìñ Introduction
This project implements a **Pacman-style game** on an FPGA using the DE10-Lite board for real-time graphics and gameplay logic, combined with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W for AI-driven ghost movement.

- **Display:** VGA output from DE10-Lite to monitor.
- **Controls:**  
  - `KEY0` / `KEY1` ‚Üí Movement (Up/Down or Left/Right)  
  - `SW0` ‚Üí Toggle movement mode  
  - `SW9` ‚Üí Start screen toggle  
  - `SW8` ‚Üí System reset  
- **AI:** The Pico uses a Q-learning algorithm to dynamically control the ghost, adapting its strategy based on Pacman's position and maze layout.

**Winning Condition:** Collect all 30 pellets before being caught by the ghost. If caught, Pacman and the ghost reset to default positions.
